# Ideas

## Workflow
1 Take in email address and authenticate user
1 Get all threads / messages from the inbox
1 Analytics
1 Profit!

## Possible questions to answer
* Which emails (senders/subjects) do I tend to ignore (not open but leave in the inbox)?
* Who sends me the most ignored messages?
* If I delete/unsubscribe from this type of email, how much does that clear my inbox?


## Possible things to analyze
* Breakdown of senders of unread messages
* Breakdown of locations of emails
* Time of day that emails get sent
* Word cloud of emails
